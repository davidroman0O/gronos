### Refined Requirements for a Lock-Free Queue in Go

1. **Queue Struct**:
   - The queue operates with nodes that manage data storage.
   - A configuration struct allows dependency injection options.
   - Constructor `NewLFQueue` accepts configuration options as variadic parameters (`opts ...Options`).

2. **Activation Function Constructor**:
   - Constructor `NewActivateLFQueue` accepts an `activation func(interface{}) bool` to determine if data is active.
   - Uses the same configuration options as `NewLFQueue`.

3. **Node Management**:
   - **Configurable Size**: Each node has a configurable size, defaulting to 128.
   - **Sequential Filling**: Nodes are filled sequentially, starting from the first node to the last.
   - **Reusing Nodes**: Empty nodes at the beginning are moved to the end for reuse, ensuring no nodes are destroyed.
   - **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations from the Go standard library (e.g., `LoadInt`, `SwapInt`, `CompareAndSwapInt`) to manage free space within nodes and ensure thread safety.

4. **Queue Management**:
   - **Execution Control (Ticks)**: Each Tick represents a control point where the first node is processed, and data is dequeued.
   - **External Tick Control**: The `Tick()` function is called externally to control execution timing. The queue does not manage the frequency of Tick calls.
   - **Triggered Dequeuing**: Dequeuing occurs through a triggered channel when data is available.
   - **Mutex Usage**: 
     - If the queue has only one node, it uses a mutex for synchronization.
     - If the queue has more than one node, it operates lock-free without using the mutex.

5. **Concurrency Handling**:
   - **Avoid Direct Dequeue**: Direct dequeue methods are avoided to prevent concurrency issues.
   - **Continuous Enqueue**: Enqueuing continues on new nodes, allowing full nodes to be processed while still accepting new data.
   - **Single Node Processing**: Nodes are tagged as being processed; only one node is processed at a time.
   - **Execution Skipping**: If `Tick()` is called while a node is being processed, it skips execution to avoid double computation.

6. **Enqueue Operations**:
   - **Single and Batch Enqueue**: Support for enqueuing single items or multiple items (`enqueue` and `enqueueN`).

7. **Metrics and Throughput**:
   - **Time Series Metrics**: Maintain a history of metrics through each `Tick` execution as a time series.
   - **Throughput Calculation**: Track the delta time between each `Tick` execution to determine data throughput.
   - **Node Reuse**: Use throughput metrics to manage node reuse effectively.

8. **Node Lifecycle Management**:
   - **Node Reuse**: Nodes are always reused and not destroyed.
   - **Node Count Checking**: During each Tick, check the number of nodes. If there is more than one node, handle potential movement for reuse.
   - **Developer Control**: Provide a function to return the number of nodes. Developers must create a new queue and wait to consume all data from the current one in edge case scenarios.

### Discussion Points

- **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations from the Go standard library (e.g., `LoadInt`, `SwapInt`, `CompareAndSwapInt`) to manage node free space and capacity efficiently.
- **Tick Handling**: External control of Tick is the responsibility of the developer using the queue.
- **Node Reuse**: Nodes will always be reused by default. Provide a function to return the number of nodes, allowing developers to manage edge case scenarios by creating a new queue and consuming all data from the current one.

Feature evelope:
    - [] registry the record message types

# I need find a way to better organize workflow of messages between multiple routers of multiple domains
# I need a way to "force" my way of programming middlewares

Features todo:
    - [ ] Change slightly the API for resource management style OR make a middleware alternative, i think we should both have middlewares and resource management somehow, i just provide tools and you build your stuff
    - [ ] Implement a supervisor: a runtime application can panic or return an error, it should be restarted
    - [ ] `envelope` package containing helpers to deploy minimalist EDA systems 
    - [ ] lot of examples about evelope
    - [ ] if we can force cancel and shutdown, we could have an hiden force panic to quick shutdown
    - [ ] saga implemented as dynamic dag + runtime applications that holds the transactions and release it depending of the state of the request

# the question is: from an api endpoint, how to use the EDA to orchestrate all the things that are needed to be done?

Research:
    - [ ] How can I do SAGAs?
    - [ ] How can I do batches of messages?

Feature middleware:
    - [ ] reducer analysis middleware
    - [ ] TUI companion to observe the gronos
    - [x] web companion to observe the gronos
